#This YAML file is intended as an empty template and documentation for YAML files used to configure the data grid

inherits_from: #for v2. name of another recipe which this one will partially overwrite
name: #a short, unique name for the recipe
title:  #a display name for the recipe
type:  #for v2. this will let us distinguish different types of data grid like 'preparedness' or 'crisis' or 'hdx curated' or 'automatically generated', but not used in v1
description: #for v2. we may show this in the interface somewhere to help users understand different recipes, but not used in v1
categories: #list of the high level groupings visible in the data grid, like 'Food Security'
  - name: #a short unique name for the category
    title: #the text that appears at the top of each grouping in the data grid
    type: #for v2. we may want to distinguish between 'preparedness' and 'crisis' at the category level
    description: #text that appears on hover of the title
    data_series: #list of the actual indicators or data series into which the datasets are categorized, like 'food prices'
      - name:  #a short unique name for the data series
        title: #the text that appears in the interface to at the top of each data series list of datasets
        description:  #the definition of the data series. 
        type: #for v2. we may want to distinguish between 'preparedness' and 'crisis' at the data series level
        rules:  #the set of 'include' and 'exclude' rules that determine what datasets appear in the data series
          include: #a list of queries (OR between each list item) that create a list of datasets to include in the data series
            - 
          exclude: #a list of queries (OR between each list item) that remove datasets from the data series
            -
        metadata_overrides: #for v2.  a list of settings at the dataset level which forces the dataset to be included and controls how it is displayed in data grid.  This is where information coming from "manual curation" is stored (unless we decide to build it as a db).
          - dataset_id:  #id of dataset to include and override
            display_state:  #a string that determines how the dataset will be displayed in datagrid.  Might split this into several states like "query match state", "freshness state", "definition state", "geo extent state"
            comments: # a string to pop up on hover over a dataset in the grid.  this would contain comments from whoever did the curation about limitations of the dataset
